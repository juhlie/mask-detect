# Mask Detection & Fun Stuff

## CSCI 241 Fall 2021 Final Project

Julie Lam, Muntaha Rahman, Marilyn Recarte, and Izzy Snyder

The current state of things -
We're using [this](https://github.com/nothings/stb) very pared down library for image manipulation
main.c takes in an image name as an argument, converts it to grayscale, and saves it as grayed.jpg
We're only handling JPGs/JPEGs so we can ignore the alpha channel in PNGS

Next -
Do the k-means clustering stuff lol
