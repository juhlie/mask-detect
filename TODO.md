# STUFF TO DO

### Tier 0

Research the processes involved in training models and deep learning. Investigate specific technologies and frameworks that we can use in our project. Produce a project outline and preliminary tech stack. Delegate tasks to group members.

### Tier 1

Accomplish face detection using machine learning in C++. This is our minimum viable product, and we will be satisfied if this is our entire final project.

### Tier 2

Use deep learning to train a model that is capable of detecting a masked versus non-masked face.

### Tier 3

Connect a live camera to this deep learning model.

### Tier 4

Connect Arduino/hardware components (red/green light, alarm/buzzer) to the camera, and have them activate based on masked versus non-masked status
